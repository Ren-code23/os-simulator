FINAL PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
===============================

This file summarizes what has actually been implemented in our OS Algorithms App. Writers, use this as your checklist for what to cover in the manuscript. Nothing here is AI-generated—all points are based on features present in the final app.

--------------------------------
Major Features (Core Functionality)
--------------------------------

Deadlock (Banker’s Algorithm):
- User provides the number of processes and resources, along with allocation, max needs, and available amounts.
- Input is done using interactive matrices in the dashboard.
- The app calculates and shows the "Need" matrix.
- Performs safety check and outputs "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" status instantly.
- If a safe sequence exists, it is shown, along with a plain-language summary and actionable suggestions.

Page Replacement Algorithms:
- FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms are implemented (selectable via UI).
- Users enter the reference string and select the number of frames.
- After running, step-by-step results are shown for every algorithm, with clear markers for page faults and hits.
- Includes a comparative analysis section showing total faults, best/worst performing algorithms, and calculated hit/miss rate % for each.
- Additional recommendations are shown (e.g. when one algorithm is clearly superior for a scenario).

CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
- FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin algorithms are all included.
- Process list can be built dynamically (specify ID, arrival time, burst, priority, quantum for RR).
- Gantt chart is displayed after calculation, visualizing the schedule.
- Table shows per-process waiting/turnaround times, and averages are automatically calculated.
- CPU Utilization and throughput metrics are included, along with performance summaries and brief recommendations.

---------------------------
Security & Robustness Features
---------------------------
- Login page with sample/test accounts (admin, user, test). Session is tracked; logout button is present.
- All inputs are validated. Blank, invalid, and out-of-range data are rejected with error messages.
- Error handling is built-in to every section. Prevents running calculations with missing or incorrect input.

--------------------------
Design / GUI / Usability
--------------------------
- 8-bit retro design throughout the app: pixel-art backgrounds, animated icons, and large themed headers.
- Each algorithm and dashboard section has its own header and color scheme for clarity.
- "Help" boxes appear on every module, explaining each algorithm in simple terms.
- “Quick Start” sample data buttons for deadlock, paging, and scheduling modules pre-fill the forms for easy demonstration.
- Export and copy buttons let the user save or copy algorithm results for reporting.
- The entire user interface uses a consistent retro font (Press Start 2P) for a uniform look and feel.
- All layouts adapt for mobile/tablet screens; app is responsive and touch-friendly.

-------------------
Progressive Web App
-------------------
- Web manifest included with correct app name, background color, and icon
- App can be installed as a standalone window from browser (“Add to Home Screen” is enabled)
