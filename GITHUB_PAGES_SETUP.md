# GITHUB PAGES SETUP - Deploy Your App

## WHY GITHUB PAGES?

Since we're already using GitHub, GitHub Pages is the easiest option:
- Already have the repository
- No need for another account
- Free and easy
- Automatic deployment
- Professional URL

## QUICK SETUP (5 MINUTES)

### Step 1: Go to Your Repository Settings

1. Go to: https://github.com/Ren-code23/os-simulator
2. Click the "Settings" tab (top right of repository page)

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
2. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select "main" branch
4. Select "/ (root)" folder
5. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Wait (1-2 minutes)

GitHub will build and deploy your site. You'll see a message like:
"Your site is live at https://ren-code23.github.io/os-simulator/"

### Step 4: Test

1. Open the URL: `https://ren-code23.github.io/os-simulator/`
2. Test all features
3. Share with team and professor!

## YOUR LIVE URL

Once deployed, your app will be available at:
```
https://ren-code23.github.io/os-simulator/
```

Anyone can access this from anywhere!

## UPDATING YOUR SITE

Every time you push to GitHub, your site automatically updates:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push
```

Wait 1-2 minutes, and your live site will update automatically!

## ADVANTAGES OF GITHUB PAGES

1. **Already Set Up** - Using GitHub already
2. **Free** - No cost
3. **Automatic** - Updates when you push
4. **HTTPS** - Secure connection included
5. **Professional URL** - yourusername.github.io
6. **Easy** - Just enable in settings

## FOR YOUR PROJECT

Perfect for:
- Sharing with professor
- Video demonstration
- Team collaboration

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Site not showing
- Wait 2-3 minutes (first deployment takes time)
- Check if "main" branch is selected
- Make sure index.html is in root folder

### Problem: Changes not updating
- Wait 1-2 minutes after pushing
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Check if you pushed to main branch

### Problem: 404 Error

## CUSTOMIZING URL (Optional)

If you want a shorter URL, you can:
1. Rename repository to something shorter
2. Or use a custom domain (advanced, not needed)
