PERFORMANCE TASK INSTRUCTIONS
OS MINI-APPLICATION / TOOL PROJECT

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Your group will design and develop a Mini-Application / Simulation Tool that demonstrates your
understanding of key Operating System concepts. The tool must allow a user to input data and observe how the
system processes information using TWO OR MORE OS algorithms from the topics we discussed.
The app does not need to be advanced, but it must be:
- Functional
- Accurate
- Clear in showing OS behavior

I. REQUIRED FEATURES
Your application must implement TWO OR MORE of the following OS concepts:

1. Scheduling Algorithm (choose one or more)
   - FCFS
   - SJF (preemptive or non-preemptive)
   - Priority Scheduling
   - Round Robin
Your tool must:
   - Accept process details (burst time, arrival time, priority, etc.)
   - Generate computed results
   - Show Gantt chart or timeline
   - Display waiting time & turnaround time

2. Deadlock / Resource Allocation
Choose one or more:
   - Resource Allocation Graph simulation
   - Deadlock Detection
   - Deadlock Avoidance using Banker's Algorithm
Your app must:
   - Accept resource allocation input
   - Show safe/unsafe states
   - Demonstrate how deadlock occurs or is prevented

3. Page Replacement Algorithms
Choose one or more:
   - FIFO
   - LRU
   - Optimal

Your app must:
   - Accept reference string & number of frames
   - Display step-by-step page table
   - Count page faults

4. Protection and Security Feature
Choose one:
   - Login system (simple username/password)
   - Basic permissions (Admin/User mode)
   - Input validation & error handling
   - Simple encryption of saved data
(Must be functional but not necessarily advanced.)

II. TOOLS YOU MAY USE
Your group may use:
- Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript
- Excel or Google Sheets with formulas
- A simple web app
- Scratch-like tools
- PowerPoint/Canva-based simulation (with logic explanation)

III. REQUIRED OUTPUTS

A. Working Mini-Application
   - Should run without errors
   - Must implement two or more OS algorithms/features
   - Interface must be GUI

B. Demonstration Video (5-10 minutes)
Must include:
1. Introduction of your app
2. Running at least two OS algorithms/features
3. Explanation of results
4. Demonstration of security/protection feature
5. Clear roles of group members

C. Written Report / Manuscript
Your group must submit a short report containing:

1. Introduction
   - Purpose of the application
   - Why your group chose the selected algorithms

2. Application Overview
   - Tools/language used
   - How the program works
   - Screenshots of the interface

3. Algorithm Sections
For each algorithm used (two or more):
   - Explanation of how the algorithm works
   - How your app implements it
   - Sample inputs and outputs

4. Protection & Security
   - Description of the security feature
   - Importance and relevance to operating systems

5. Challenges & Solutions
   - Errors encountered
   - How the group resolved them

6. Member Reflection
Each member answers:
   - Role in the project
   - OS concept they understood better
   - Skills they improved

IV. SAMPLE PROJECT IDEAS
Here are example directions your group may take:

CPU Scheduler + Page Replacement Demo
A tool that compares FCFS, SJF, and RR plus LRU vs FIFO.

Deadlock Avoidance + Scheduling Simulator
Shows how processes and resources are allocated and scheduled.

Page Replacement Toolkit + Security Login
App simulates page faults and has a simple login system.

Multi-Feature OS Visualizer
Includes:
- One scheduling algorithm
- One deadlock algorithm
- One security feature
